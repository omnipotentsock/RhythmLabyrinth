# RhythmLabyrinth

### Welcome to Rhythm Labyrinth,
an open-source point-and-click adventure game built off of Crowther's "Colossal Cave Adventure" game model!

In this game, the player must reach the end of the adventure map by battling and advancing through point-and-click minigames. Currently, only one adventure/map is supported!

*This game is currently under development. If you wish to contribute, message me on Discord at @adoopted.*

- Add the following VM options to the IDE:

```
--module-path
